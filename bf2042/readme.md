### BF2042 User.cfg

Put this file in your battlefield 2042 install directory.
It will load when your game runs, and it allows you to tweak certain settings.

In this case it tweaks CPU utilization parameters.
The example in my file tells Battlefield 2042 to use 8 cores and 16 threads.

There are apparently reports you get unstable performance if you exceed 17 threads, so try to stick at or below 17, even if you have more.
